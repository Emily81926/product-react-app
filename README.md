## Reflections

#### What I have learned

 `Framework of Reactjs project`

organize the codes in folders, such as components , pages, context, hooks, assets and so on

`Reactjs function component and hooks`

create function component, apply `useState` and pass the props to manipulate the value, use `useEffect` to make the request right after the component renders, and apply `useContext` to pass the value and method without passing through several component layers

`Bulma CSS framework`

use Bulma framework to style the app, and apply some libraries to accelerate the development , such as Card and Modal component, Hero layer, column styles, and so on

`ErrorHandling`

to prevent the page from crashing due to the server error, I use react-error-boundary to log the error, and add ErrorFallback page when page cannot render the ProductList page

`React-spinner, React-rating-stars component`

use react-spinners and react-rating-stars to build the special styles of these elements

`Suspense and Lazy`

to fill the blank page when component is still rendering, add suspense and lazy method to show the spinner during the suspense time

`Coding style custom setting`

Not only use Prettier and Eslint extensions in vscode, also add prettierrc.json to customize the coding style, such as donâ€™t use the semi colon, use the single quote, make jsx bracket at the same line, and so on
